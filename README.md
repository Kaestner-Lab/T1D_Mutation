  <h3 align="center">Increased frequency of Somatic hypermutation at the HLA locus in the pancreas of type 1 diabetics</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Initiation of islet autoimmunity in human type 1 diabetes (T1D) is often lobular in nature, with
	certain lobes of the pancreas containing high levels of immune infiltrates, while others are at least
	temporarily spared1. We hypothesized that de novo somatic mutations which arise locally during
	pancreas development might be responsible for this critical feature of T1D pathogenesis. Using
	whole-exome sequencing of the pancreas from non-diabetic and T1D deceased organ donors, we
	discovered that the 4 megabase HLA (human leukocyte antigen) region exhibits a somatic
	mutation rate ~ 62-fold higher than the remainder of the genome. Importantly, pancreata from
	T1D individuals were significantly enriched for mutations in the MHC class I genes HLA-A, HLAB,
	and HLA-C. These HLA genes, which function in antigen presentation by epithelial cells,
	exhibited multiple mutations in the antigen-binding pocket and T cell receptor contact regions in
	the pancreas of T1D patients. We propose a novel model for initiation of autoimmunity in which
	somatic hypermutation of the MHC class I genes in pancreatic epithelial cells alters the avidity of
	interaction of certain cellular antigens with T cells that, while exhibiting central tolerance, thus
	become tissue reactive. In this way, somatic mutations modify the inherited risk for T1D and
	contribute to the complexity of the disease. We posit further that somatic mutations of MHC class
	I genes could also contribute to other autoimmune diseases with mosaic phenotypes, such as
	Crohnâ€™s disease and vitiligo, and modify the inherited genetic risk of the individual for these
	diseases.
